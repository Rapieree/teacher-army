![Johnny Earle - You're In The Army Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpmMiZKqBK4)


A vacation in a foreign land  
Uncle Sam does the best he can  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh, you're in the army nowNow you remember what the draftsman said  
Nothing to do all day but stay in bed  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh, you're in the army nowYou be the hero of the neighborhood  
Nobody knows that you left for good  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh, you're in the army nowSmiling faces as you wait to land  
But once you get there no one gives a damn  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh, you're in the army now
